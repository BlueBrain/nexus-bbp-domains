# Ingest Allen Cell Types Database in Nexus


## Overview

![Ingest Allen Cell Types Database in Blue Brain Nexus](./assets/nexus_workshop_data_pipeline.png)

## What you'll build

* A pipeline demonstrating how to: 
    * collect data from a remote source: [Allen Cell Types Database](https://celltypes.brain-map.org/)
    * ingest the collected file data in a knowledge graph within Blue Brain Nexus
    * map the collected metadata to the Neuroshapes data model
    * ingest the mapped metadata in a knowledge graph within Blue Brain Nexus
    * find ingested data in the knowledge graph
    * download filtered subsets of data from the knowledge graph
    
  
## What you'll learn

* How to leverage a knowledge graph as part of a data pipeline to ingest and manage (meta)data, search for data and record data provenance

## What you'll need

* Python 3.5 or higher with support of Jupyter notebook
