# In vitro single cell Electrophysiology Recording

## Use case

### Description

This specification describes metadata collected for single cell in vitro electrophysiology experiments using the whole-cell patch-clamp configuration. Metadata is collected on the subject used in the experiment, the slice, the patched cell which was recorded as well as the recording traces and protocols. Additionally, metadata for the brain slicing, the whole-cell patch-clamp and the stimulus used to generate traces are captured.

### Competency questions (to be completed)

The following points describe a subset of questions the provenance pattern above can support:
 
* Retrieve all electrophysiology traces generated from rat somatosensory cortex using selected stimuli
* Retrieve electrophysiology traces by recording day
* For a given stimulus / sweep / repetition, get a specific voltage or current trace.
* Get the liquid junction potential for an individual trace
