# In vitro cell morphology reconstruction

## Use case

### Description

This specification describes metadata collected for in vitro morphology reconstruction using a slice. The process of obtaining a 
reconstructed cell typically begins with the injection of a dye during the electrophysiology recording. Some of the activities
and entities shown here are shared with the electrophysiology whole-cell patch-clamp recording. The metadata is collected
starting with the specimen, the slice, the patched cell. The stained neuron is most commonly visualized with a histological procedure
 following the fixation of the tissue where the cells can be identified and annotated to proceed then with the reconstruction
 of the cell. Metadata from all these procedures is captured as well as the protocols used and the persons, software and 
 organizations involved in each of the steps. The reconstructed cell has the link towards the binary file with the actual 
 morphology reconstruction.
